    "\n",
    "Event: GAIN Monthly Dialogue Session – March 2026\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is this workshop about?\n",
    "Rice prices vary across Ghana. Mapping these differences helps us understand affordability and food security. We will use geospatial data and Python to answer two big questions:\n",
    "1. Where is rice affordable?\n",
    "2. Where is pricing information missing?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### GeoAI\n",
    "Using AI and spatial data to answer questions about the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GeoDataFrame\n",
    "A table where each row also has a location stored as a shape or point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial Join\n",
    "Connecting observations to the place they belong on the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choropleth Map\n",
    "A map where areas are colored based on a value (for example, median price).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Median vs Mean\n",
    "Median is less sensitive to extreme values and better for real market data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diagrams (Add your own sketches)\n",
    "- Markets as points\n",
    "- Regions and districts as boundaries\n",
    "- Spatial join = placing points into regions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions for You\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before coding\n",
    "Where do you expect rice to be cheapest? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "### After the regional map\n",
    "Which regions are expensive? Which are affordable?  \n",
    "What might explain this? (Transport? Imports? Demand?)\n",
    "\n",
    "### After the district map\n",
    "Where do we lack data?  \n",
    "Why might those areas not be monitored?\n",
    "\n",
    "### After the LLM interface\n",
    "How does the LLM support analysis without doing the analysis itself?\n",
