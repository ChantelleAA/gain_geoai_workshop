        "1. Loaded real Ghanaian rice price data from the World Food Programme (WFP)\n",
        "2. Converted tabular data into geospatial data using points and coordinates\n",
        "3. Linked market observations to Ghana's regions and districts using spatial joins\n",
        "4. Created choropleth maps showing spatial patterns of rice affordability\n",
        "5. Identified and interpreted data gaps at the district level\n",
        "6. Built a natural language interface using Gradio and understood the role of LLMs in data analysis\n",

        "**Spatial Patterns:**\n",
        "- Rice prices vary significantly across Ghana\n",
        "- Urban and coastal regions may show higher prices\n",
        "- Production and transportation infrastructure influence spatial patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Gaps:**\n",
        "- Many districts lack rice price observations\n",
        "- Missing data reflects monitoring coverage, not absence of markets or needs\n",
        "- Policymakers must account for uncertainty when making decisions\n",
        "\n",
        "**Technology:**\n",
        "- GeoAI combines spatial analysis with AI tools\n",
        "- LLMs can make analysis more accessible without compromising accuracy\n",
        "- Python handles computation; LLMs handle explanation\n",

        "1. **Compare Local vs Imported Rice**\n",

        "   - Identify seasonal patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Include Other Commodities**\n",
        "   - Apply the same approach to maize, gari, tomatoes, etc.\n",
        "   - Compare affordability across multiple foods\n",
        "   - Identify regions where multiple commodities are expensive\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Combine with Population Data**\n",
        "   - Join with census or gridded population data\n",
        "   - Calculate affordability indices (price relative to income)\n",
        "   - Identify high-risk areas for food insecurity\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Deploy the Gradio App**\n",

        "   - Add authentication for organizational use\n",
        "   - Expand query capabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Build a Dashboard**\n",
